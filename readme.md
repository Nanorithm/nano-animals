# Nano-Animals

This is a simple script to spawn animals within specific configured zones if you have a hunting license. The player needs to have been both granted a hunting license and have the hunting license item in their inventory for the animals to spawn. Animals will only spawn if the player with the license is within the zone.

**Dependencies:**
 * QB-Core (For license checks)

**Currently Configurable:**
 * Zone location
 * Zone size (circular)
 * What ped spawns within that zone
 * How many animals should spawn in that zone at a time
 * Max distance from the player the ped can spawn
 * Interval that new animals will respawn within the zone
 * Debug mode to see both the spawn zones and the ped blips

This is my first fivem script so it's probably not perfect. If you have improvements feel free to send a PR.
